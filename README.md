## Project Information

pCloud Console Client was forked from
[the project](https://github.com/pcloudcom/console-client) initially written by
pCloud Ltd to breathe new life into it and set a more dynamic pace of
development. The maintainer of this fork isn't affiliated to pCloud so this
project is as good or as bad as it gets. If you'd like to contribute to pCloud
Console Client you're most welcome!

Added Allowall users to write and mount on non empty folder.
